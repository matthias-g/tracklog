Tracklog
=======

**Tracklog** is a Ruby on Rails application for managing GPS track logs. It’s
based on Rails Edge and thus requires Ruby 1.9.

Features
--------

* Visualizing tracks on a Google Map
* Track statistics like distance, duration, speeds, ascent etc.
* Elevation profiles
* Dashboard showing overall statistics
* Graphs for last 12-month activity by distance and duration
* GPX import and export
* Basic user management

### Improvements of this fork

* Import GPX version 1.0 data generated by Holux Utility
* Full screen mode for maps
* View for a tag showing combination of all tagged logs
* Share tag with other users: Other users have read access to all tagged logs
* Option to restrict users to 'read-only'

The last two features are especially useful for the following scenario: After making a journey
with your friends you want to share your logs with them.
This is can be done by tagging all the logs of your journey, creating a read-only user and giving the user read access
to this tag. Now you can share the read-only user with your friends and they can view
all logs tagged for this journey without being able to see other logs, create or change any log.

represent to current state.)

Installation
------------

Because Tracklog is a standard Rails application, you can use your favourite
deployment tools to install Tracklog on your server. To run it locally you’ll
need to go through the following steps:

    % bundle
    % rake db:setup
    % rails server
    % open http://localhost:3000/

The default user is *admin* with the same password.

Todo
----

* Filtering of inaccurate trackpoints (maybe using the Kalman filter)
* GPS import using Garmin’s JavaScript API
* KML import
* Split GPX parsing and analyzing into a separate file/library
